# PORTFOLIO

My portfolio was written using HTML/CSS and vanilla JS.
<br>It has various basic functionalities often found on websites and a section with projects written using JavaScript.
<br> Some of these projects are not focused on visual aspects and only focus on JS code.

## Wprowadzenie – cel projektu

You can find a section on the website with my other projects written with HTML/CSS and JavaScript.
<br>
Some of the projects were written with a focus on using JS and are not necessarily fully responsive or pleasing to the eye.

## Info

The JS file contains comments that briefly describe the functions it contains and how they work.
