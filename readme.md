My portfolio is a project written by me, which contains various types of functionality and is fully responsive.

## Wprowadzenie â€“ cel projektu

You can find a section on the website with my other projects written with HTML/CSS and JavaScript.
<br>
Some of the projects were written with a focus on using JS and are not necessarily fully responsive or pleasing to the eye.

## Info

The JS file contains comments that briefly describe the functions it contains and how they work.
